# Basketball-Spacing
## Introduction
Grouping NBA Players with the K-means Clustering algorithm based on their shooting efficiency.

## Configurations Required
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.6+
- SQL

## Implemented Libraries
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- PandaSQL
- BeautifulSoup
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Strategy
1. Scrape data for shooting percentages of all NBA players
2. Data wrangling and cleaning
3. Try different values for k
4. Exploratory data analysis
5. Visualize data
6. Determine relevant features
8. Run K-Means algorithm to classify players into groups by shooting efficiency and capability
9. Scrape and find the most efficient lineups
10. Create a dataset for lineups with the most spacers
11. See if thereâ€™s correlation between spacing and success
12. Determine the minimum required number of spacers for an efficient lineup
